    Welcome! This is my webpage where there will be references to projects I am working on along with information of myself. <br><br>
    In the second tab, it will take you to my current resume where you can see my qualifications. <br><br>
    The third tab takes you to my GitHub where you can find the repository for this website. <br><br>
    In the fourth tab, there is an outline for the current project I am working on. The purpose is to create a calculator <br> 
    which takes in various water parameters and gives guidance to Fish Keepers - AquaScapers. <br>
    This guidance suggests how to improve the water quality which benefits fish life and plant life. <br>
