## Landing Page

On the landing page you can also find a menu containing links to my CV, other projects, and JavaScript practice.

## Project 1

The scope of Project 1 is to build a simple Water Measurement Calculator for Aquarium and Fish keeping hobbyists. 

The main element of the calculator is to receive water parameters, and display recommendations based on needs. The information provided will assist in improving water quality to maintain fish, aquatic plants, or both.
